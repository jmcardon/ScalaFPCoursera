# ScalaFPCoursera
Scala functional programming course work. Course done a while ago, but I felt like sharing my answers. 
NOTE: This code is old, at the beginning of my Scala journey, which was a long time ago. I felt like sharing solutions to my work now,
but this is in no way representative of the quality of code I can produce nowadays. 

Learning Scala's rich collections library, the native monads and program composition is key to producing great Scala Code.
Not only learning to use lambdas, for composition and maps,  but also writing composable programs that don't look like math equations is rather important.

This is tempting to do at first, but you'll soon find writing x => x.someOperation() becomes much harder to read months down the line.

Cheers,

Jose
